# Descope Node M2M Sample App

This is a sample Node.js application demonstrating Machine-to-Machine (M2M) authentication using Descope's client credentials flow. It allows you to exchange an access key for a JWT and call protected APIs.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd node-m2m-sample
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```env
   DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=your_descope_project_id
   DESCOPE_ACCESS_KEY=your_descope_management_access_key
   PORT=3000 # Optional, defaults to 3000
   ```

   - `DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Descope project ID (from the Descope console)
   - `DESCOPE_ACCESS_KEY`: Your Descope management access key
   - `PORT`: (Optional) Port to run the server on

4. **Start the app:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   # or for development with auto-reload
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
